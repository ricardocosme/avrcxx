** avrcxx
It's a collection of C++11/17/20 libraries to program AVR8 that shares a common set of goals and requirements. Each library should follow:

1. At least support to C++11. Support to newer standards is optional.
2. The library should be header-only.
3. The zero-overhead principle must guides design decisions and implementation.
4. Space performance is more important than speed performance, as a general rule.
5. Runtime errors should be brought to compile-time whenever possible.
6. The library doesn't need to support ~-O0~ or ~O1~.
7. The library should use the ~-Os~ as the target optimization level to be used.
8. The code written in the application layer should be expressive and concise when possible.
